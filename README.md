1. Language: SimpleCalc
2. Syntax and Semantics: SimpleCalc is a calculator language that supports basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) and parentheses for grouping expressions. It follows the following grammar rules:

   program         -> expr
   expr            -> term (('+' | '-') term)*
   term            -> factor (('*' | '/') factor)*
   factor          -> NUMBER
                   | '(' expr ')'

   - A program consists of a single expression.
   - An expression is made up of terms separated by '+' or '-' operators.
   - A term is made up of factors separated by '*' or '/' operators.
   - A factor can be a number or an expression enclosed in parentheses.

3. Lexer: A a lexer using flex. Flex allows us to define regular expressions to tokenize the input.

4. Parser: A parser using bison, a popular parser generator. Bison allows us to define grammar rules and build an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from the tokens generated by the lexer.

5. Semantic Analysis and Code Generation: We performed semantic analysis and code generation while traversing the AST. For this simple language, we evaluated the expressions and generate the output accordingly.
